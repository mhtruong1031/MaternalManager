If your baby is under 3 months, crying for more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days a week could indicate colic. Check if they're fed, clean, and comfortable. If crying persists with fever or unusual behavior, please consult a doctor.",

If vomiting persists for more than 24 hours, is accompanied by fever over 101Â°F, severe abdominal pain, or signs of dehydration, seek medical attention.",

Constipation might be due to diet changes or holding behavior. Ensure proper hydration and fiber intake.
